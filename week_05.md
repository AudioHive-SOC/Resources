# NodeJS, Express, Mongoose

## Intro
- [MongoDB in 100 Seconds | fireship.io](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bt_y4Loofg)

## Main
- [These are the last videos for this course üòÅ](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1zuYlRdC2iflooOycEBsLekZN7a1f0hcv)
- The chapter 16 discusses basic commands for terminal. The total duration is of about 1hr at 1x speed. 
- The chapters 17,18,19,20 focus on what is a backend, why we need one, and how to make REST APIs in a backend using the Express.js framework. The total duration is of about 4 hrs at 1x speed. 
- The next set of chapters 24,26,27 focus on what are databases, why do we need them, and how to use the Mongoose framework in backend to interact with the MongoDB database. The total duration is of about 2 hrs at 1x speed. 

## Logistics
Even if you watch at 1.5X or 2X, you still need time to code and comprehend, so let's say 8-10 hrs will be needed this week. You have to finish the above videos by Sunday (ig 1 - 1.5 hr per day seems good). Better start working now. Any doubts will be cleared whenever needed.

Btw, I know some of you guys are putting quite some effort into it, so here are a few changes to the course for the upcoming weeks. 

Earlier, we only had 1 week to over backend, followed by 2 weeks to learn flutter. 
Instead, we can take 1.5 weeks for backend, and the next 1.5 weeks will be practicing making some apps using React, NodeJS+Express, Mongoose, since learning a new language (i.e. Dart for Flutter) will be too much for you guys rn. 

Despite that, we can still make mobile apps with React by either making a responsive website, or we can go a step further and use frameworks like React Native or libraries like Ionic to make native apps using what we know already. The React Native framework is quite buggy and annoying to setup imo, so instead we will use the Ionic library, which instead of being a different framework, provides [native components](https://ionicframework.com/). It will be the same React code you all know and love, but with some additional components to ease your workflow. Do checkout the Ionic website's homepage to get a feel for it.

This way, you can practice your react skills before the project.

Hopefully after we have enough practice by the end of week 7, I will form groups of 2 (instead of 3, because first we are skipping flutter, and second when one is making a react component for a page, the other person can create the required APIs for that component parallely, and when you both finish your part, you can quickly integrate your APIs. Personally, this technique is really fast, which I used to complete a full hotel management system with a fellow coder in the same languages from scratch in under 40 hrs.) for the final project. I will prepare the figma designs for the app, as well as a brief description of features you have to implement in your project, by the end of week 7.
