# Extra Resources for selective improvement

Here are some extra resources you may find useful. You don't need to go through all of them compulsorily, just the ones where you are lacking.

## React

Using React and Tailwind, you have to make the app whose design is given above, further details at [this link](https://dribbble.com/shots/14784828-Weather-forecast-interface?showSimilarShots=true&_=1686868787348). For the weather data, you have to use [this API](https://rapidapi.com/visual-crossing-corporation-visual-crossing-corporation-default/api/visual-crossing-weather/). 

Here are the instructions to use this API.

1. Create a RapidAPI account to access the above API. Once done, go to the above link.
2. Click on `Subscribe to Test`  ![Image](https://i.imgur.com/r65kr9Y.png)
3. Choose the basic plan ![Image](https://i.imgur.com/9Tg3Jcf.png)
4. Start using the API by going through the docs ![Image](https://i.imgur.com/y5knbvN.png)
5. Here is a basic summary of the parameters in the API call. I have hidden my API key since the number of API calls per month are limited in the free trial. ![Image](https://i.imgur.com/EnpuxKO.png)
6. You can go through the descriptions of each parameter in the middle section. Since we will be working with json instead of csv data, change `csv` to `json` on the marked position. Also, you can test run the API in the browser itself using the marked button. ![Image](https://i.imgur.com/gqxPHO5.png)
7. You can select `Javascript > Axios` to get the code to use in the react app. ![Image](https://i.imgur.com/Zzo521O.png) 
8. In your browser, while running the react app, click on the marked button to use mobile view ![Image](https://i.imgur.com/V1ykRN9.png)
9. Use the `iPhone 12 Pro` view while making your app. ![Image](https://i.imgur.com/Ya7cG5a.png)

## Tailwind CSS
1. Code along in meet (will explain later)
2. [Hulu clone with Tailwind](https://www.youtube.com/live/MqDlsjc8GLo?feature=share). Since we are only interested in learning tailwind from this video, you can ignore coding alongside the video and just observe how Sonny uses tailwind to make a specific design. You can search the required css properties and tailwind docs alongside instead of coding in this video.
