# HTML, CSS and Javascript
## Introduction
First of all, **HTML** is not a programming language, just a markup language, like **Markdown** or **LaTeX**.
**CSS** is also not a programming language, it's rather a stylesheet language.
**Javascript** is a programming language.

In simple terms, we use HTML to create non-interactive content, CSS to style the content, and Javascript to make that content dynamic.

Like [this page](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~biswa/courses/CS230/main.html) from our Computer Architecture course. This page also involves some **Javascript**, because of which the view changes when you click on the buttons on top.
