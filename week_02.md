# Logistics
For making sure whoever is continuing on with AudioHive is regular in the weekly tasks, I will be segregating you guys into groups of 3. I will announce the teams in 1-2 days. 

For the assignment, there are 30 projects in total. 
Each team is to split them into 10 projects for each person, and each team will be held accountable for the work-progress of all of its 3 members.

(these projects are very small, the assignment is like medium-difficulty).

Since the projects already have solutions given in the course, the grading will be on a team-wise interview next week to explain the code properly. 

(kya kya jugad karna padta hai)

Also, since each project itself can have multiple implementations, even though the solutions exist, I would expect a personalized UI design or custom functionality from everyone.

Remember, the goal of this week is to learn and apply javascript, and since we have just begun this project, I would prefer not to burden you guys with unnecessary stuff at the beginning. 
Personally, it's not like I can solve all 30 projects without seeing any documentation or references. 
My skill is that I know the basics of Javascript, and if I have the internet, I can code what I think of. 

That's this week's lesson.
