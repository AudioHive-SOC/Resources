## Individual scores
**Aymaan (6.5/10)** <-- 3 (no checkbox) + 1 + 0 + 2 + 0.5 (key)

**Ayushi (8/10)** <-- 3 (printed json-object instead of text) + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 (1 for smart use of useState, 0 for incorrect use of key)

**Falak (5/10)** <-- 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 (for using timestamp as key)

**Kanika (9/10)** <-- 4 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 2 (1 for styling + 1 for using timestamp as key)

**Manav (8.5/10)** <-- 4 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 1.5 (0.5 for bootstrap + 1 for using timestamp as key + (could have got 0.5 more for aria attributes, but lost it because you used class instead of className while copying code from bootstrap, which vscode should have already warned you about because of the `.eslintrc.cjs` file in the project))

**Nilesh (5.5/10)** <-- 2 (-1.5 for incorrect folder structure (dude u literally submitted 2 files), -0.5 for brackets missing) + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1.5 (1 for styled-components package, 0.5 for key)

**Parul (10/10)** <-- 4 + 2 + 0 + 1.5 + 2.5 (1 for addTodo using enter key because of form-onSubmit, 2 for custom method of hold to delete, -1 for not clearing index.css before starting work and not using tailwind, 0.5 for key)


Others either did not submit or submitted a fresh project template, so unfortunately they will get 0 for this assignment. 

These are not the marks I am submitting on the mentor form, since the final marks are an aggregate of a bit of contribution from the javascript assignment also.

## Some personal notes
- Congrats on getting through the frontend portion of this course. You all did a good job. Personally, backend is more of a mechanical thing and is initially more involved since you also have to interact with the database, but it is more fun imo.
- Now that we have come so far, someone recently pointed out that you guys need time to prepare for your exams. Keeping that in mind, there will be **no SoC work from my side from 5th June (Monday) to 19th June (Sunday)**. Your exams will be over by 16th or 17th ig, so chill out for a few days. We will continue from 20th June (Monday). 
- I will be making a video correcting and improving each of your codes (my inner self asking why am I punishing myself like this ðŸ˜…), so stay tuned XD. 
- For your efforts till now, **I want to treat you guys** (online walo mujhe maaf karna) this week. Since I am busy till Friday, and leaving for Pune for the weekend (for some 'ME' time), how about **Friday 11 PM - 00 AM at H2 canteen** ? DM me if anyone is uncomfortable with the timing, and we can adjust accordingly.
