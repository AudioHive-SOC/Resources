## Weekly Timeline
Week 1: Basic HTML, CSS and Git/GitHub essentials

Week 2: Learn Javascript

Week 3: Learn ReactJS framework

Week 4: Practice ReactJS + understanding backend fundamentals 

Week 5: Learning NodeJS and ExpressJS frameworks, and using them with the Mongoose library for MongoDB

Week 6: Learn Flutter Basics

Week 7: Learning to use standard flutter packages for correct coding practices 

Week 8-10: Apply all concepts and research on required libraries/frameworks to create AudioHive 

## Description
The project is to create a social networking app similar to Clubhouse, named AudioHive. The app will allow users to participate in live audio conversations with other users on various topics. The app will have a user-friendly interface with features such as user profiles, chat rooms, and the ability to create/join rooms based on various topics of interest, and listen to or participate in conversations in real-time.  

Throughout this program, you will learn and continuosly apply basics concepts of HTML, CSS, Javascript. Next, you will learn and use the beginner-friendly ReactJS framework to structure the frontend of your app into components and get used to this coding paradigm. Next up, we will introduce you to the brains, i.e. the backend. You will learn how to create APIs to supply data from a database like MongoDB to your frontend using the backend, and learn to ideate models to structure your data. Then, we will dive into the popular frontend framework Flutter, which will help you to create apps for any screen using a single codebase with ease. We will cover popular flutter packages like Provider to systematically access data from our backend. 

On a weekly basis, the mentees will be given coding challenges for each topic to apply their learnings till Week 7. Starting from Week 8, the mentees will be required to group into pairs and research on required libraries/frameworks to create a web app in react, a mobile app in flutter, with backend in NodeJS for AudioHive.
