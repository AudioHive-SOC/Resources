# ReactJS
## Resources and Tools

### Tools
- If you go to the Installation section in the React docs, they recommend "create-react-app" and it's similar counterparts. However, "create-react-app" is really slow, and so instead we will be using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). A video for react setup is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17NpLyWpeW58vijDKlsW4ZlQxFg3vpNFP/view?usp=share_link)

### Start here
- [React in 100 seconds | fireship.io](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn6-PIqc4UM)

### Now, focus here
- No videos this time ðŸ™ƒ. The course videos are too much (45). The latest [React documentation](https://react.dev) released a few months ago is stupid-simple. Your task is to finish the following 3 pages: [Quickstart](https://react.dev/learn), [Tutorial:tic-tac-toe](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe), and [Thinking in React](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react).

### Useful docs
- [React Docs](https://react.dev)

### Assignments
- In-process (this time we will have plenty of stuff to make)

### Extras
- [React for the Haters in 100 Seconds | fireship.io](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyWYpM_S-2c)
